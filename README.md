# Self-Assessment of the Final Project: Covid-19 Vacation Planner 
## Self-Assessment – My Role
My role in our group project were the following: 
<br> - Proposed the topic for our project
<br> - Project Manager wherein I broke down planning steps 
<br> -	I also created the Google Slides with the purpose of planning, documentation/tracking of deliverables, and ultimately evolved to final presentation
<br> - Updated ReadMe content every week and final edit after each member’s contribution
<br> - Found resources for Tourist and Vaccination information
<br> - Data analysis and ETL: 
  <br> - Selected Top 10 most visited countries and pulling most recent Covid data from these countries to create the Cities dataset CSV then converted to JSON format for Leaflet coding
  <br> - Selected Top 10 safest countries from Covid-19 data with ML prediction numbers to create the Top 10 safest cities dataset CSV then converted to JSON format for Google API
<br> - Built the Interactive Map via Leaflet and built the Google API Hotel map
<br> - Exported Gmaps FIG to html to be added to the dashboard
## Self-Assessment – Supporting Role
During the weeks my part of the project was completed, I supported team members by updating the ReadMe and Google Slides primarily.  I also assisted with troubleshooting with ML and data visualization codes to support the team.  
## Self-Assessment – Challenges
The greatest personal challenge over the course of the project was figuring out ways to work with Leaflet and Google API with the data that we have.  I researched and attempted several ways on how to present the data meaningfully and make it interactive.  Also, taking extra time to work with the group outside of the class hours was challenging between work, class, and family. 

I overcame these challenges by planning and allotting ample time for troubleshooting and researching.  
## Team Assessment
### Communication Protocols
The project team will communicate updates via Slack.  We will meet weekly during class hours to discuss and update each other on the progress.  We will be meeting during weekends as well so we can help each other troubleshoot any issues we may have.
### Strength and Recommendations
Our team is well-balanced wherein each member used their own strength in assigning parts of the project.  We have strong communication and can rely on each other for support.  Our team also had a lot of fun working on our project and learning from each other.  
## Summary of Project
Our data science project is to create an interactive platform to showcase the safest place to vacation during this time.  We utilized several data sources which are Covid-19 cases data, Tourist data from 2019, and Covid-19 vaccination data. 

The final product is an interactive map which displays Top 10 most visited countries plus Covid-19 data and Vaccination data and Top 10 safest places with Covid-19 data and predicted Covid-19 cases from the Machine Learning model. 

The Machine Learning model we used was the Random Forest Regression model to predict confirmed Covid cases based on the current trend.  

The result of the analysis showcased a 99% Training and Testing Accuracy scores.
